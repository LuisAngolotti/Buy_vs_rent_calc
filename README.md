# Buy vs Rent Calculator

Have you ever wondered if it's better to buy a house or rent it?
The answer may surprise you!

Long story short: it all depends on the assumptions you make.
The good thing is that with this tool, you can play with the assumptions and figure out what scenario you are most comfortable with.


### Some important assumptions:

The scenario plays over 30 years by default, which is the typical lenght of a first mortgage and long enough for most assumptios to hold on average.

We are assuming that house prices follow inflation rates over this 30 year period, and that inflation rate is close to the 2% targetted by most OECD central banks. This may seem low given recent raises in house prices but, as a famous economist once said, "If something can't go on forever, it won't".

We suggest you use the same rent payment as what you would pay for the mortgage, but you can always change that figure yourself.
